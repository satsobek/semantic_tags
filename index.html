        <h3>The Back Story</h3>
            <p>
              I was originaly born in Baltimore Maryland, but grew up in the
              Seattle area. I was a <big><u>huge</u></big> <b>nerd</b> growing up-
              obsessed with History and Science. I spent countless summers
              Cival War Re-eniacting with my parents and volunteering in the
              Appplied Physics Lab at the University of Washington.
              For most of my childhood I wanted to become a neurosurgeon and
              attend Johns Hopkins!
            </p>

            <p>
              College changed my path, as I decided to study Forensic
              Anthropology. While I passionately enjoyed studying human remains
              (I know, kinda creepy), I found the criminilistic components of my
              studies boring. I was taking some Archaeology and Geology classes
              as electives and decided to jump ship! So I became an Archaeology
              major with an emphasis on preshitoric artificat analysis and
              conflict studies. I still got to study ancient remains and solve
              mysteries without the <q>boring</q> crimnal and law studies.
            </p>

            <p>
              When I graduated College I took a year off to be an
              AmeriCorp Volunteer where I taught children with Autism for
              one year in Walla Walla. I also volunteered at the Fort Walla
              Walla Museum, and when my AmeriCorp service was over I started
              working for the museum as an Arhcaeologist. I worked as a Field
              Archaeologist and Lab Manager for 3 years before we lost funding
              and I moved back to Seattle.
            </p>

            <p>
              These days I am working for the Office of Animal Welfare at the
              UW doing aboslutely nothing related to Archaeology. I was
              originally hired as an Administrative Assistant but was moved
              into a more technical position after I implemented SharePoint
              in our Office. I taught myself how to use SharePoint and fell
              in love with it (<i>I know, I'm weird!!</i>). SharePoint is
              actually my gateway into Computer Science and Web Development.
              I also serve as a technical consultant in our eIACUC solution,
              HoverBoard.
